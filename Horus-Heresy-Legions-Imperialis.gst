      <description>Hits scored by a weapon with the Light trait against a Vehicle, Super-heavy Vehicle, Knight or Titan model are automatically discarded, before any Save rolls are made. In other words, a weapon with this Trait cannot damage models from the listed Detachment types.

In addition, Hits scored by a weapon with this Trait cannot be allocated to Void Shields, regardless of the weapon&apos;s AP, and thus are automatically discarded if a target has active Void Shields.</description>

    <rule id="0462-6759-307e-3004" name="Deep Strike" publicationId="c1b8-2180-635c-14cd" hidden="false" page="88">
      <description>During deployment, if all models within a Detachment have the Deep Strike special rule, then the Detachment can be placed in Reserve instead of being deployed as normal. Detachments with the Deep Strike special rule in Reserve can only be issued the Advance Order or March Order.

When a Detachment with the Deep Strike special rule that is in Reserve is activated in any Movement phase other than the first, the controlling player may choose to leave it in Reserve or Deep Strike the Detachment. When a Detachment Deep Strikes, the controlling player places a single model from that Detachment anywhere on the battlefield at least 2&quot; from an enemy model. They then Scatter that model D6&quot;. If the model scatters into an area of Impassable terrain or a Structure then that model, and the model&apos;s Detachment, is destroyed. If it scatters within 1&quot; of an enemy model, it must be moved the shortest possible distance so it is no longer within 1&quot; of an enemy model.

Once scattered, any remaining models within the same Detachment are placed on the battlefield within 2&quot; of the already placed model. A model cannot be placed in an area of Impassable terrain or overlapping a Structure, not can it be placed within 1&quot; of any enemy model. Any model that cannot be placed in this manner is destroyed. Once a Detachment has Deep Striked, it may complete its activation as normal (i.e., it may move during the Movement phase and/or fire during the Combat phase, etc.).

Some Detachments have both the Deep Strike and Transport (X) special rule. If another Detachment is loaded into the Transport model during deployment, that Detachment is kept in Reserve alongside the Transport model. When the Transport model is set up via Deep Strike, the Embarked model then immediately Disembarks and can then be activated as normal later in the phase.</description>

      <description>A Detachment which contains one or more models with the Implacable special rule does not take Morale checks when they lose a Combat. Instead, the controlling player may choose if the Detachment Withdraws or not. An Engaged Implacable Detachment that does not Withdraw remains Engaged; if no models in the Detachment are in base to base contact with an enemy model, the Detachment does not move and is no longer Engaged.</description>

    <rule id="f921-10ce-33f7-19fd" name="Point Defence" publicationId="c1b8-2180-635c-14cd" hidden="false" page="82">
      <description>A weapon with the Point Defence trait represents a weapon system tailored towards defensive fire, be that heavy bolter sponsons on a Vehicle or the Ardex weapons of some Titans.

Models with at least one weapon with the Point Defence trait may choose to fire on its Detachment&apos;s target or a Secondary Target; a Secondary Target is an eligible target (i.e., within range and line of sight of the firing model) different from the first chosen target. All Point Defence weapons in a Detachment must fire at the same target, unless another rule overrides this.

A Detachment which contains one or models with weapons with the Point Defence trait may fire those weapons during the Movement phase, if issued an Advance or March Order, or the Combat phase. During the Movement phase, a Detachment may fire its Point Defence weapons immediately after it is activated or at the end of its activation; all Point Defence weapons must fire at the same target unless otherwise specified; if fired at the start of its activation, the firing is resolved and then the Detachment completes its activation as normal. A Detachment can only fire its Point Defence weapons once per round - if it fires one or more of its Point Defence weapons in the Movement phase, it cannot fire any Point Defence weapons in the Combat phase.

If fired during the Combat phase, a weapon with the Point Defence trait is fired like any other weapon. Models with Point Defence weapons may fire them at a different target from the Detachment&apos;s main target.

Point Defence weapons can be fired as part of an Overwatch attack. When fired as part of an Overwatch attack, Point Defence weapons ignore the -2 penalty to Hit rolls and instead fire as normal (i.e., use the To Hit value of the weapon then apply any positive or negative modifiers).</description>

      <description>A weapon with the Skyfire trait can target Flyers as normal instead of requiring a natural 6 to hit. In addition, when a model fires a weapon with the Skyfire trait as part of an Overwatch, subtract 1 from the result of the Hit rolls rather than 2.

Models with at least one weapon with the Skyfire trait may choose to fire on its Detachment&apos;s target or a Secondary Target; a Secondary Target is an eligible target (i.e., within range and line of sight of the firing model) different from the first chosen target. The Secondary Target must be a model with the Flyer special rule. All firing Skyfire weapons must target the same Flyer Detachment, unless another rule overrides this.</description>

      <description>Models with the Flyer special rule operate differently to other Detachments on the battlefield and are subject to the unique set of rules described below.

Unless instructed otherwise, Flyers are not deployed on the battlefield at the start of the battle and are instead placed in Reserve. Unless instructed otherwise, a model with the Flyer special rule that is in Reserve can only be issued with an Advance Order or a March Order. Any weapons with the Point Defence trait that the Flyer has count as having the Skyfire trait when firing upon an enemy model with the Flyer special rule.

When activated during the Movement phase, the controlling player places the Flyer so the rear of its base is touching a point on the controlling player&apos;s board edge or touching any board edge at a point within 8&quot; of the controlling player&apos;s board edge. The Flyer then moves and can only move in a straight line. A Flyer can make a single turn of up to 90° during its movement. Flyers can move over any model or area of terrain during their movement. A Flyer can end its movement overlapping Impassable terrain.

Flyers fire as normal during the Combat phase. Due to their altitude, a Flyer is considered to have line of sight to all models on the battlefield, unless instructed otherwise. Similarly, all Detachments are considered to have line of sight to a Flyer. A Flyer suffers no penalties to Hit rolls for targeting obscured models, though they do suffer penalties for firing upon Detachments within an area of terrain as normal.

In the Remove Flyers stage of the End phase, all Flyers on the battlefield are removed and placed back in Reserve - they do not count as being destroyed and may return to the battlefield in the following round. Any Wounds a Flyer has suffered remain; for example, if it leaves the battlefield having suffered 2 Wounds, when it next returns it still has suffered 2 Wounds.

Due to the altitude a Flyer operates at, Flyers are ignored for the purposes of calculating who controls an Objective. Flyers do not have an Engagement zone, cannot be Engaged and/or Pinned and do not block line of sight. As Flyers do not have an Engagement Zone, other models, friendly or enemy, can move through a Flyer&apos;s base and finish their move in base contact with it - while a model can end its move overlapping a Flyer&apos;s base, it is best to avoid this where possible.

Unless otherwise instructed, any model firing at a model with the Flyer special rule can only Hit on a natural roll of a 6, regardless of modifiers. If a weapon uses a template, such as the Flame template or the Blast template, a model with the Flyer special rule is ignored when calculating Hits unless the weapon also has the Skyfire trait.</description>

    <rule id="4078-b206-6442-bbfa" name="Hover" publicationId="c1b8-2180-635c-14cd" hidden="false" page="90">
      <description>Some models with the Flyer special rule also have the Hover special rule. A model with the Hover special rule is not automatically removed from the battlefield during the End phase. Instead, the controlling player may choose to &apos;Hover&apos; the Flyer.

A model that Hovers exchanges the Flyer special rule with the Skimmer special rule. If within 1&quot; of an enemy model, or overlapping another model&apos;s base, move it the shortest possible distance to prevent this. If the model is within an area of Impassable terrain, it is destroyed. For the remainder of the battle, the model is no longer a Flyer and instead functions as a Skimmer, following all the rules for Skimmers as follows.

During the Resolve End Phase Effects of the End phase, a model with the Hover and Skimmer special rules can choose to take off. If it does so, it replaces the Skimmer special rule with the Flyer special rule. This happens before Flyers are removed from the battlefield and as such the model will be removed as normal. The player with Initiative determines which of their Detachments will Hover first.

If a Detachment with the Hover special rule contains more than one model, then all models within the Detachment must choose to Hover or take off at the same time.

Detachments with the Flyer and Hover special rules can be deployed on the battlefield in &quot;Hover Mode&quot;. If they are, they lose the Flyer special rule and gain the Skimmer special rule, as if they had chosen to Hover at the end of a round. They can take off later in the battle as normal.</description>

      <description>When firing a weapon with the Barrage trait, a model may target Detachments that it does not have line of sight to, as long as the target Detachment is in range and meets all other criteria for a valid target. Models firing against targets they cannot draw line of sight to suffer a -1 penalty to all Hit rolls.

Hits caused a Barrage weapon fired in this way can be allocated to any model in the target Detachment that is within range of the firing model. If some models from a Detachment are visible and some are not, the controlling player can choose to only target the visible models - if they do so, they do not suffer a -1 penalty but any Hits scored cannot be allocated to models outside of the firing model&apos;s line of sight.

If a Barrage weapon targets a Detachment that is Garrisoned within a Structure then all Detachments Garrisoned within it are targeted. Make Hit rolls against each Detachment Garrisoned within the Structure, equal to half the Dice value of the weapon (rounded up) - this reduction in Dice happens even if only one Detachment is Garrisoned within.

      <description>When firing with a weapon with the Beam trait, the controlling player draws an imaginary straight line 1mm wide from the weapon, or the firing model if the weapon is not physically represented, up to its maximum range; if the weapon has an Arc, the end of the line must be within the specific Arc of the firing model. Make Hit rolls for each Detachment (friend or foe) that has at least one model under that line equal to the Dice value of the weapon - models with the Flyer special rule are ignored and not hit. Any model from each Detachment you make Hit rolls for that is within range of the firing model and within the correct Arc (if applicable) can be allocated scored Hits.

If the line would pass over an area of Impassable terrain or a Structure then the line &apos;stops&apos; as soon as it hits them - any Detachment further out does not suffer Hits, though Detachments Garrisoned in the Structure do.

Beam weapons cannot be fired as part of an Overwatch. As a weapon with the Beam trait does not choose a dedicated target, the Detachment may pick any eligible target to fire on, including a target that is not hit by the Beam.</description>

    <rule id="a981-166d-49aa-1064" name="Blast (3&quot;/5&quot;)" publicationId="c1b8-2180-635c-14cd" hidden="false" page="78">
      <description>Before making Hit rolls when firing with a weapon with the Blast trait, the controlling player places the 3&quot; or 5&quot; Blast template (determined by the number shown in brackets) so that its central hole is over a piece of the battlefield that is visible and within range of the firing model. Then, Scatter the template - a 3&quot; template moves D3+1&quot;, while a 5&quot; template moves D6+1&quot;. If a Hit is rolled, leave the template where it is.

Once the template is Scattered, make hit rolls for each Detachment that has one or more models under the Blast template; the number of Hit rolls made for each Detachment is equal to the number of models fully under the template multiplied by the Dice value of the weapon. In addition, roll a D6 for each model partially covered by the template - on a 4+, the model is counted as under the template for the purpose of calculating Hit rolls and allocating Hits, while on a 1-3 the model is ignored for such purposes. Hits scored by a weapon with the Blast trait can only be allocated to models underneath the template.

If a weapon has the Blast trait and the Skyfire trait, the template only hits models with the Flyer special rule, while if it does not have the Skyfire trait then Flyers are ignored and cannot be hit. If a Structure is under the template, then it counts as being under the template regardless of how much of it is covered. If one or more Detachments are in the Structure, and the central of the template is completely over the Structure, treat each model in those Detachments as partially under the template (and thus roll a D6 for each one). If the hole is not completely over the Structure, then models Garrisoned within the Structure are ignored.

If a Detachment is firing other weapons, then the Blast template must be placed so that at least one model from a Detachment chosen as a target by the other weapons is under the template. If a Detachment contains multiple models with weapons with the Blast trait, then place a single template first and scatter it; any additional templates must be placed so the central hole is within 2&quot; of the first Blast template.

Weapons with the Blast trait cannot be fired as part of an Overwatch.</description>

      <description>Weapons with the Bombing Run trait do not as normal. Instead, at any point during a model&apos;s move it may pause its movement to attack with any weapons it has that have the Bombing Run trait, following the normal firing sequence. A model firing a weapon with the Bombing Run trait can only target a Detachment or Structure within 3&quot; of it. Each of a model&apos;s Bombing Run weapons can only be fired once per round. Models with the Flyer special rule cannot be chosen as targets by a weapon with the Bombing Run trait.

When firing a weapon with the Bombing Run trait, Hits are resolved as normal and can only be allocated against models within 3&quot; of the firing model. If a Bombing Run weapon targets a Detachment that is Garrisoned within a Structure, or targets the Structure itself, then both the Structure and all Detachments within it are targeted. Make Hit rolls against the Structure equal to the Dice value of the weapon and make Hit rolls for each Detachment Garrisoned within the Structure equal to half the Dice value of the weapon (rounded up). Resolve firing against the Structure first. If a Structure is destroyed in this way, firing is resolve against any surviving Detachments after it collapses.

Once the model has resolved firing its weapons with the Bombing Run trait, it continues moving. A model with multiple weapons with the Bombing Run trait may pause its movement as many times as it wishes to in order to fire a weapon with this Trait that it has yet to fire with, so long as it declares all weapons that are firing each time it does so before rolling the dice. A weapon with the Bombing Run trait cannot be fired in the Combat phase - if not fired in the Movement phase, it cannot be fired that round.

Roll a D6 for each model that is less than 50% covered by the template - on a 5+, the model is counted for the purpose of calculating Hit rolls and allocating Hits. On a 1-3, the model is ignored for such purposes.

      <description>When firing a weapon with the Graviton Pulse trait, the To Hit value of the weapon is equal to the Armour Save characteristic of the target Detachment. If the Detachment has models with different Armour Save characteristics, then use the characteristic shared by the majority of the models; if there is an equal number of models with different characteristics, use the worse value. A model with an Armour Save characteristic of &apos;-&apos; can only be Hit on a natural roll of a 6. The weapon&apos;s AP is applied when Hits are scored, not when making Hit rolls (meaning the base characteristics is used for Hit rolls).

If a weapon with the Graviton Pulse trait also has a Trait that allows it to damage Structures then it hits Structures on a 3+, regardless of its Save characteristic and ignores any modifiers to the Hit rolls. Make a Save roll for each Hit scored against a Structure by a weapon with the Graviton Pulse trait; for each Save roll that is passed, the Structure suffers D3+1 Wounds. The Structure suffers no Wounds if the Save roll is failed.

Graviton Pulse weapons cannot be fired as part of an Overwatch. Furthermore, this Trait has no effect when firing at a model with the Flyer special rule unless the weapon also has the Skyfire trait - if it does not, Hits are scored only on a natural roll of a 6 as normal.</description>

      <description>Models with the Independent special rule function with a greater degree of autonomy. All models with this special rule and the same name within a Detachment form an &quot;Independent Unit&quot;. A Detachment can have multiple Independent Units within it, with each Independent Unit consisting of models of the same name. The remaining models (i.e., those without the Independent special rule) are referred to as the &quot;Detachment Core&quot;.

All models within an Independent Unit must maintain a 2&quot; Detachment Coherency with other models in the same Independent Unit and a Detachment Coherency of 6&quot; with the Detachment Core - at least one model from each Independent Unit must remain within 6&quot; of one or more models from the Detachment Core.

If the controlling player wishes, each Independent Unit may be issued its own Order during the Order phase - this can be a different Order from the rest of its Detachment. In addition, models within the Independent Unit may choose a different target than the rest of their Detachment when firing - all models within an Independent Unit must fire at the same target unless specified otherwise.

Though it has its own Order, the Independent Unit is still part of the larger Detachment, and thus activates and reveals its Order at the same time, is issued with a Fall Back Order if the Detachment is, etc. If the Detachment calls an Overwatch, an Independent Unit only discards its Advance Order or First Fire Order if one of its models fired during the Overwatch, not if other models from the Detachment did so.

A Detachment that contains one or more Independent Units is only considered to be Engaged if a model without the Independent special rule is Engaged. If one or more models with the Independent special rule are Engaged, then all models within that Independent Unit are also Engaged, however the larger Detachment can still act as normal, providing they maintain Detachment Coherency. In other words, an Independent Unit and its Detachment count as two separate Detachments for the purposes of determining Combats and determining which models are Engaged.

Models with the Independent and Deep Strike special rules may start the game in Reserve even if the larger Detachment is deployed on the battlefield - all models in an Independent Unit must be deployed in Reserve if one is. When the Independent Unit arrives via Deep Strike, it must be deployed within 6&quot; of one or more models from the larger Detachment (i.e., within Detachment Coherency). The Independent Unit does not scatter, but must follow all other rules related to Deep Striking. If all other models from the Detachment have been destroyed before the Independent Unit has Deep Striked, then it is placed as if it were a normal Deep Striking Detachment.</description>

Models may start the battle deployed within a Transport. When deploying a Detachment which contains one or more models with the Transport (X) special rule, the controlling player may declare that it is transporting models - they state which models are Embarked on the Transport and place those to one side. All models Embarked within a Transport must be declared when it is deployed and all models within the same Detachment must be deployed in Transports if one model is, and all the chosen Transports must be part of the same Detachment.

When being issued an Order during the Order phase, a Detachment with the Transport (X) special rule is issued an Order as normal. A Detachment that has one or more models within a Transport is issued an Order separately but can only be issued certain Orders depending on the type of Transport - unless otherwise instructed, that Detachment can only be issued an Advance Order or March Order.

If part of a Detachment is Embarked upon a Transport and another part of it is not (e.g., due to the latter part&apos;s Transport being destroyed), the non-Embarked models maintain Coherency with the Transports.

If a Transport is destroyed while transporting Detachments, make a Save roll for each model within it, using a Save characteristic of 4+, or the model&apos;s own Save characteristic if it is better. This Save roll is not modified by the AP of the weapon that destroyed the Transport. If the Save is failed, that model suffers a Wound. The models are then placed on the battlefield within 2&quot; of the destroyed Transport&apos;s location - if a model cannot be placed (due to enemy models&apos; Engagement Zones, Impassable terrain or not enough space, etc.), that model is destroyed.

      <description>Void Shields are energy shields that absorb incoming fire and prevent damage to those equipped with them. A model with the Void Shields (X) special rule has a starting Void shield level equal to the number shown in brackets. Models with a Void Shield level of 1 or more are said to have active Void Shields.

When one or more Hits are scored against a model with active Void shields, Hits are first allocated to the Void Shields. Each time a Hit is allocated to a model&apos;s Void Shields, reduce its Void Shields level by 1 then discard the Hit. Once the Void Shield level reaches 0, the Void Shields collapse and are no longer active. Any remaining Hits are allocated to the model and resolved as normal.

Hits can only be allocated to Void Shields if they were scored by a weapon with a modified AP of -1 or better; Hits scored by weapons with an AP of 0 or worse (after modifiers) against a model with active Void Shields are automatically discarded and do not reduced the model&apos;s Void Shield level.

During the End phase, in the Resolve End Phase Effects stage, a model with the Void Shields (X) special rule may attempt to reignite any collapsed Void Shields. The controlling player rolls a number of D6 equal to the difference between a model&apos;s current Void Shield level and its starting Void Shield level. For each 4+ rolled, increase that model&apos;s Void Shield level by 1.</description>

    <rule name="Remote Controlled Detonation" hidden="false" id="c783-cc80-fdd9-b883">
      <description>If a model with the Remote Controlled Detonation special rule ends its movement within 12&quot; of a friendly model with the Commander special rule, it may detonate. When a model detonates, it attacks with all of its weapons that have the Blast (3&quot;/5&quot;) trait. The central hole of the Blast template is placed over the detonating model - it does no damage to itself (i.e., don&apos;t make Hit rolls for the detonating model) and the template does not Scatter. Once the effects of the detonation have been resolved, the detonating model is destroyed.


If a Detachment contains more than one model with this rule, the controlling player can choose which models detonate and which do not, doing so before resolving any detonation. Models that detonate are not affected by friendly models that are detonating at the same time. Any model that does not detonate is affected if it is under the Blast template as normal.</description>
